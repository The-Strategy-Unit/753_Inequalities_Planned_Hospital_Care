The documents should be read in conjuntion with the main report (https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/publications/socio-economic-inequalities-access-planned-hospital-care-causes-and-consequences).

There are seven r-markdown output files, in html format, in the repository which relate to the substantive chapters in the main report. These files describe the data that was used, and the methods used to assemble,organise and analyse this data.  The seven files can be access via the links below:
